# 💤 Sleep, Scan, Repeat: *The Ultimate Nap Quest*

> *Scan. Rate. Nap. Repeat.*

---

## 🌙 Overview

Are you a **nap enthusiast**? A **snooze connoisseur**? Or perhaps a **professional horizontal thinker** who’s mastered the art of falling asleep in the weirdest corners of campus?

Welcome to **Sleep, Scan, Repeat** — a **multimedia, Python-powered nap rating system** that turns your resting habits into a game. Think of it as Pokémon Go, but instead of catching monsters, you’re catching Zs.

Players can **scan QR codes**, **rate nap zones**, take a **Sleep Personality Quiz**, unlock **nap achievements**, and receive **cryptic, randomly generated quotes** to ponder between REM cycles.

## 🧠 Concept

We believe sleep deserves the same hype as gaming or caffeine. This project explores the art of resting through **interactive design, code, and comedy** — encouraging players to embrace their inner nap gremlin.

## ⚙️ Features

### 🛏️ Nap Rating System

Rate different campus (or public) locations based on comfort, noise, light levels, and nap quality.
Earn achievements for discovering new zones or becoming a “Legendary Sleeper.”

### 📱 QR Code Hunt

Each nap spot is paired with a QR code that links to its rating page or unlocks random nap-related secrets.

### 🧩 Sleep Personality Quiz

An MBTI-style quiz that classifies your snooze type — are you a “Library Dozer,” “Couch Dreamer,” or “Lecture Hall Phantom”?

### 🧠 Random Quotes Generator

Every scan may reveal a mysterious message.

> “You are both the sleeper and the dream.”
> “Was that a nap, or a time skip?”
> “In another life, you were a pillow.”
